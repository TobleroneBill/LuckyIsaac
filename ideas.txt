Luck Char - 
snowballs with luck items

Starts with lowest luck, but random chance for lucky coin drops
start with perfection trinket? (test runs)

Cursed shovel effect also comes into play at high luck levels, so the higher your luck is, the more often she drops her foot
stomp should use kim voice lines

100 luck is like 100% for every item effect
luck would need to be used like a resource - spent for reduced risk, but wanted for better deals and stuff
