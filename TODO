- Press enter to reduce hp in exchange for luck pennies (should probably be item)

- Higher luck stat initates effects more frequently:
    - Stomping mom using kims voice
    - Spawning a lucky coin
    - (-1 * luck) from consumables (Bombs,Keys,other stuff)
    - spawn a random enemy
    - spawn a random item
        - item tier is based on luck (higher the luck the bigger the range of tier items)
    - spawn a boss
        - higher the luck, the worse the boss
